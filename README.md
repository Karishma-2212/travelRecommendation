# 🌍 Travel Recommendation Web Application

A simple and interactive **Travel Recommendation Website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project suggests destinations based on user keywords like **beach**, **temple**, or **country**,  
and displays related images, descriptions, and even the **local time** of the country.
